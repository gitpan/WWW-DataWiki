- ",edit" could have syntax highlighting. Either a CodeMirror plugin for N3,
  or do it server-side (which would require porting my N3 highlighter from

consider
===========================

- allow graphs to contain { <> :ping <endpoint> .} triples which allow them to
  ping endpoints other than PTSW.

- DELETE /wikipage,version
  + deletes a version
  
- DELETE /wikipage
  + deletes graph if "Pragma: nuke" header is used

- SEARCH / (with SPARQL ASK payload)
  + returns list of wikipages where the ASK returns true (checking only
    latest version of each page).

- SEARCH /wikipage (with SPARQL ASK payload)
  + returns list of versions where the ASK returns true.

- LOCK /wikipage

- UNLOCK /wikipage

- POST /wikipage,acl (with RDF payload)
  ACL /wikipage (with RDF payload)
  + grant 

- DELETE /wikipage,acl?uuid=...
  + deny

- GET /wikipage,acl
  + retrieve

- port from Catalyst to Magpie, which appears to be a better framework for
  this project.
