NAME
    WWW::DataWiki - RESTful read-write RDF repository

SYNOPSIS
      script/www_datawiki_server.pl

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::DataWiki is a RESTful read-write RDF repository. Powered by
    Catalyst, RDF::Trine and RDF::Query, it provides you with a wiki-like
    site where each page, rather than being a textual document is an RDF
    graph (actually, technically it's an N3 graph, so supports a slight
    superset of RDF).

    Graphs are versioned, and each graph (each version in fact) acts as its
    own SPARQL endpoint. HTTP content negotiation serves up graph data as
    HTML, Turtle, RDF/XML, JSON; and query results as HTML, XML, JSON, CSV
    or tab-delimited data.

    WWW::DataWiki is fully RESTful, using HTTP GET to retrieve the graph,
    HTTP PUT to replace the graph with a new version, HTTP DELETE to replace
    the graph with an empty graph (and there may be an option in the future
    to delete the graph and its entire history), HTTP POST to append RDF
    data to the graph, and HTTP PATCH to alter the graph using the SPARQL
    Update language. (SPARQL Query and Update can also be tunnelled over
    POST; and SPARQL Query can be tunnelled over GET.)

    WWW::DataWiki exposes graph history using the HTTP headers described at
    <http://www.mementoweb.org/>.

    WWW::DataWiki offers some rudimentary support for RFC 2324.

    In the current release there is very little user interface, and to
    manage graphs you probably need to use a command-line tool like "curl"
    or "lwp-request".

    There is currently no support for authentication or access control. You
    may be able to use external forms of access control.
